This can be done through marketing strategies, establishing a digital presence, or implementing appropriate business intelligence. As the growth of transactional data in the marketplace, Market Basket Analysis (MBA) enables data scientists to apply statistical and mathematical techniques to gain revenue. Basically, the concept of MBA works to generate patterns from the ransactional data, which will provide insights for increasing profits.
